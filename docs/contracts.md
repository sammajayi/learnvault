# LearnVault Smart Contract Reference

## Contract Overview

| Contract               | Language     | Purpose                                                                                     |
| ---------------------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `LearnToken`           | Soroban/Rust | Soulbound reputation token (LRN) — minted on milestone completion, non-transferable         |
| `GovernanceToken`      | Soroban/Rust | Transferable DAO voting token (GOV) — minted to donors on deposit, earned by top learners   |
| `CourseMilestone`      | Soroban/Rust | Tracks learner progress per course, triggers LRN minting on verified checkpoint completion  |
| `ScholarshipTreasury`  | Soroban/Rust | Holds donor USDC funds, mints GOV to donors, creates escrows for approved proposals         |
| `MilestoneEscrow`      | Soroban/Rust | Manages tranche disbursements to scholars, returns unspent funds after 30-day inactivity    |
| `ScholarNFT`           | Soroban/Rust | Soulbound credential NFT minted to scholars who complete their funded program               |
| `UpgradeTimelockVault` | Soroban/Rust | Isolated vault for secure contract upgrade timelocking with governance-controlled execution |

## Contract Interaction Diagram

    CM[CourseMilestone] -->|mint LRN on verified milestone| LT[LearnToken]
    ST[ScholarshipTreasury] -->|mint GOV on deposit| GT[GovernanceToken]
    ST -->|create_escrow on approved proposal| ME[MilestoneEscrow]
    ME -->|mint credential on program completion| SN[ScholarNFT]
```

**Interaction summary:**

- `CourseMilestone` → `LearnToken`: calls `mint` when a learner's checkpoint is
  verified
- `ScholarshipTreasury` → `GovernanceToken`: calls `mint` proportional to a
  donor's USDC deposit
- `ScholarshipTreasury` → `MilestoneEscrow`: calls `create_escrow` when a
  scholarship proposal passes DAO vote
- `MilestoneEscrow` → `ScholarNFT`: calls `mint` when a scholar completes all
  funded milestones

### CourseMilestone Management

- Courses must be registered on-chain by the configured contract admin using
  `add_course(admin, course_id, milestone_count)`.
- Course management is admin-only: only the same admin address stored during
  `initialize` can add or remove courses.
- Course lookup is available through:
  - `get_course(course_id)` to fetch one course configuration
  - `list_courses()` to return active course IDs
- Enrollment is validated against course registry state:
  - `enroll(learner, course_id)` rejects unknown or inactive courses
- Course removal uses lifecycle deactivation:
  - `remove_course(admin, course_id)` marks the course inactive instead of
    deleting its record
  - inactive courses remain readable via `get_course` but are excluded from
    `list_courses` and cannot be newly enrolled into

## Deployment Order

Contracts must be deployed in this order due to cross-contract dependencies:

1. **`LearnToken`** — no dependencies
2. **`GovernanceToken`** — no dependencies
3. **`ScholarNFT`** — no dependencies
4. **`UpgradeTimelockVault`** — no dependencies
5. **`CourseMilestone`** — requires `LearnToken` address
6. **`ScholarshipTreasury`** — requires `GovernanceToken` address
7. **`MilestoneEscrow`** — requires `ScholarshipTreasury` and `ScholarNFT`
   addresses

## Upgrade Timelock Vault

The `UpgradeTimelockVault` implements a dedicated vault pattern for secure
contract upgrades with timelock enforcement.

For the current V1 in-place upgrade procedure used by the six core contracts,
see [contract-upgrades.md](./contract-upgrades.md).

### Security Model

The timelock vault provides the following security guarantees:

1. **Isolated Storage**: Upgrade proposals are stored separately from governance
   logic, preventing accidental modifications or exploits in the governance
   contract from affecting queued upgrades.

2. **Timelock Enforcement**: All upgrades must wait for a mandatory timelock
   period (default 48 hours) before execution, providing time for community
   review and potential cancellation.

3. **Admin Control**: Only the vault admin can queue or cancel upgrades,
   ensuring centralized control during the initial deployment phase.

4. **Event-Driven Transparency**: All operations (queue, execute, cancel) emit
   events for full transparency and monitoring.

5. **Cancellation Capability**: Queued upgrades can be cancelled by the admin at
   any time during the timelock period, providing a safety mechanism for
   discovered issues.

### Upgrade Flow

1. **Queue**: Governance contract calls `queue_upgrade()` after proposal
   approval
2. **Wait**: Community monitors the queued upgrade during timelock period
3. **Execute**: After timelock expires, governance contract calls
   `execute_upgrade()` to retrieve the WASM hash and perform the upgrade
4. **Cancel**: Admin can cancel the upgrade at any time before execution

### Integration with Governance

The vault is designed to be used by the governance system:

- The `ScholarshipTreasury` contract would be extended to handle upgrade
  proposals
- Upon approval, it calls `vault.queue_upgrade(contract, wasm_hash)`
- After timelock, it calls `vault.execute_upgrade(contract)` and performs the
  actual upgrade
- The vault enforces the timelock and provides isolated storage
