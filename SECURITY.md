vulnerability in an unsupported version, please verify it is still present in a
supported version before reporting.

| Version                    | Status                | Security fixes                     |
| -------------------------- | --------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `main` branch (Testnet v1) | ✅ Active development | ✅ Yes                             |
| Previous commits / tags    | Superseded            | ❌ No — please test against `main` |
| Mainnet                    | 🔜 Not yet deployed   | N/A                                |

## Scope

### In scope

We are interested in vulnerabilities that could harm users, funds, or the
integrity of the LearnVault protocol:

**Smart contracts** (`contracts/`)

- Reentrancy attacks on any contract
- Integer overflow / underflow in arithmetic operations
- Access control bypass (calling admin-only functions without authorization)
- Logic that allows unauthorized withdrawal from `scholarship_treasury`
- Exploits against `milestone_escrow` that release funds without meeting
  conditions
- Governance manipulation via `governance_token` (vote inflation, double-voting)
- Sybil or replay attacks on `scholar_nft` minting
- Timelock bypass in `upgrade_timelock_vault`
- Allowlist circumvention in `fungible-allowlist`

**Frontend / dApp**

- Cross-site scripting (XSS) that could execute arbitrary code in a user's
  browser
- Wallet-draining UI — any page or component that causes a wallet to sign a
  transaction the user did not explicitly intend
- Phishing vectors hosted on the official domain
- Insecure handling of private keys or seed phrases

**Protocol logic**

- Any flow that allows a learner, mentor, or third party to extract funds from
  the treasury without meeting the stated course-completion criteria

### Out of scope

The following are **not** in scope. Please do not submit reports for:

- Vulnerabilities in third-party libraries or upstream dependencies — report
  these directly to the relevant project
- Issues that require physical access to a user's device
- Theoretical vulnerabilities with no working proof of concept
- Rate-limiting or brute-force issues on read-only public endpoints
- Social engineering attacks targeting LearnVault team members
- Spam or content-policy violations
- Clickjacking on pages without sensitive actions
- Missing security headers on informational/marketing pages

## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Do not open a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.**

Use one of the following private channels:

### Option 1 — GitHub Private Security Advisory (preferred)

1. Go to the
   [LearnVault security advisories page](https://github.com/bakeronchain/learnvault/security/advisories/new).
2. Click **"Report a vulnerability"**.
3. Fill in the template with as much detail as possible.

GitHub keeps the report private and notifies the maintainers immediately.

### Option 2 — Email

Send your report to **security@learnvault.xyz**.

Encrypt sensitive reports with our PGP key if possible (key available on request
via the email address above).

### What to include in your report

Please provide as much of the following as you can:

- **Description** — what the vulnerability is and why it is exploitable
- **Affected component** — contract name, frontend route, or API endpoint
- **Proof of concept** — steps to reproduce, test script, or transaction hash on
  a testnet demonstrating the issue
- **Impact assessment** — what an attacker could achieve (e.g. drain treasury,
  mint arbitrary NFTs)
- **Suggested fix** (optional but appreciated)

## Disclosure Policy

LearnVault follows **coordinated disclosure**:

- Please **do not publish or share** details of a vulnerability before a fix has
  been released.
- Once a fix is deployed we will coordinate a public disclosure date with you.
  The default embargo period is **90 days** from the initial report, or sooner
  if both parties agree.
- We will credit you in the release notes and changelog unless you prefer to
  remain anonymous.
- We will not pursue legal action against researchers who act in good faith and
  follow this policy.

---

## Recognition

Responsibly disclosed vulnerabilities will be credited in the project's release
notes. If you would like to be acknowledged:

- Tell us your preferred name / handle in the report.
- We will list you under **"Security"** in the relevant release or CHANGELOG
  entry.

We do not currently operate a paid bug bounty programme, but we are grateful for
every responsible disclosure and aim to recognize the effort publicly.
